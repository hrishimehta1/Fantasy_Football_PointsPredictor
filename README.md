Sports Prediction Research
This repository contains the code and data for a sports prediction research project. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict various statistics in sports based on historical data. The predictions can be used to gain insights into player performance, team strategies, and game outcomes.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The data is preprocessed and transformed to create relevant features for the prediction models. This includes handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Advanced feature engineering techniques, such as polynomial features and interaction terms, are applied to capture complex relationships and interactions among different variables.

Machine Learning Models: Several machine learning models, including linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and LSTM networks, are implemented and trained to predict various sports statistics. Each model is tailored to the specific prediction task and optimized for accuracy and performance.

Ranking Generation: Predicted statistics are used to generate rankings for players or teams based on predefined category weights. The rankings provide a comprehensive evaluation of performance across different metrics.

Comparative Analysis: The predicted results are compared to actual data and existing benchmarks to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the prediction models. This helps in assessing the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
